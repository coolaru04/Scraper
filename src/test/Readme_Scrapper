This project is to automate scrapper and create a Json file and save user directory

Lets now talk about the two testcases.

Common methods In Wrapper class:

1. Method name --- goToURL 
For all testcases to open the youtube url i have created a common method to be called before every test case execution.
2. Method name --- enterText
To clear and enter the text in a textbox and press enter
3.  Method name --- clickButton
Common method to click a button


testCase01: Go to this website and click on "Hockey Teams: Forms, Searching and Pagination" 

1. Go the url provided with scrapper() method which will open the website
2. click the hockey link 
3. Call the teamDetails() Wrapper method which will perform all the validation for the testcase.
4. Create a ArrayList<HashMap<String, Object>> teamList = new ArrayList<>();
5. Loop through the values from page 1 to 4 and do the following:
   a) Get the parent element and with For Each loop iterate and get the child elements and store in Map
   b) Initialise a Map 
   HashMap<String, Object> dataMap = new HashMap<>();
   c) check if the win percent <0.4 then get the team name, Year and Win % and store it in a Map
   d) Then Put the values in a Array List
   e) if page<4 then click on next arrow else exit.   
5. Create a object of Mapper
6. Print the list values in console with the object created
7. Use the Mapper object and write the Json file in the path userDir + "\\src\\test\\resources\\JSONFromHockeyList.json"

testCase02: Go to the "Films" or "Movies" tab and in the “Top Selling” section, scroll to the extreme right. Apply a Soft Assert on whether the movie is marked “A” for Mature or not. Apply a Soft assert on the movie category to check if it exists ex: "Comedy", "Animation", "Drama".

1. Go the url provided with scrapper() method which will open the website
2. click the Oscar link 
3. Call the checkOscarFilm() Wrapper method which will perform all the validation for the testcase.
  Wrappers.checkOscarFilm("2015",driver);
  Calling the method for each year
4. Loop through the values for called year(e.g, 2015) and do the following:
   a) Click on the year.    
   b) Initialise a ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> filmInfoList = new ArrayList<>();
   c) Get the parent webElement 
     List<WebElement> filmrows = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//tr[@class='film']"));
   d) initialise a count=1 for making the first element alone as true for best picture film for all others it will set to false since we increase the counter in the for loop
   e) Go through the For each loop for all the parent weblement values (filmrows) for 0 to 5 (since as per testcase we need only first 5 values)
   c) Get and add the following values in the Map (HashMap<String, String> filmMap = new HashMap<>();)
	Epoch Time of Scrape, Year, Title, Nomination, Awards, isWinner
   d) Put the values in a List 
   e) Increment the counter (count++)
5. Create a object of Mapper
6. Print the List values in console with the object created
7. Use the Mapper object and write the Json file in the path --- new File(userDir +"/src/test/resources/"+year+"-Oscar-Winner-data.json");
8. Assert if the file is created and not empty.
    Assert.assertTrue(jsonFile.length() != 0);



Finally end the testcase and close the scrapper website.
