This project is to automate scrapper and create a Json file and save user directory

Lets now talk about the two testcases.

Common methods In Wrapper class:

1. Method name --- goToURL 
For all testcases to open the youtube url i have created a common method to be called before every test case execution.
2. Method name --- enterText
To clear and enter the text in a textbox and press enter
3.  Method name --- clickButton
Common method to click a button
4. Method name --- createEpochTime
Common method to return a Epochtime to the calling function.

testCase01: Go to this website and click on "Hockey Teams: Forms, Searching and Pagination" 

1. Go the url provided with scrapper() method which will open the website
2. click the hockey link 
3. Call the teamDetails() Wrapper method which will perform all the validation for the testcase.
4. Loop through the values from page 1 to 4 and do the following:
   a) Get the full table in a webelement and loop through again
   b) Initialise a array list
   c) check if the win percent <0.4 then get the team name, Year and Win % and store it in a Array List
   d) Put the values in a Map 
   e) Reinitialize the arraylist   
5. Create a object of Mapper
6. Print the map values in console with the object created
7. Use the Mapper object and write the Json file in the path userDir + "\\src\\test\\resources\\JSONFromMap.json"

testCase02: Go to the "Films" or "Movies" tab and in the “Top Selling” section, scroll to the extreme right. Apply a Soft Assert on whether the movie is marked “A” for Mature or not. Apply a Soft assert on the movie category to check if it exists ex: "Comedy", "Animation", "Drama".

1. Go the url provided with scrapper() method which will open the website
2. click the Oscar link 
3. Call the checkOscarFilm() Wrapper method which will perform all the validation for the testcase.
4. Loop through the values of all years(2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010) and do the following:
   a) Get the full table and traverse through only first 5 films in a webelement and loop through again
   b) Initialise a array list
   c) if there is flag in the Best Picture then make (isWinner = true) for all other values make it as false.
   c) Get and add the following values in the Array List.
	Epoch Time of Scrape, Year, Title, Nomination, Awards, isWinner
   d) Put the values in a Map 
   e) Reinitialize the arraylist   
5. Create a object of Mapper
6. Print the map values in console with the object created
7. Use the Mapper object and write the Json file in the path userDir + "\\JSONFromFilmMap.json".
8. Assert if the file is created and not empty.


Finally end the testcase and close the scrapper website.
